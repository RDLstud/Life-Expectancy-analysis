By combining exploratory data analysis, data visualization, and regression modeling, the project aims to identify key socioeconomic and health-related factors that influence life expectancy across different countries.

🎯 Objectives
Making a good Exploratory Data Analysis in order to extract informative knowledge about the target variable Life Expectancy and all the numerical and categorical explanotory variables.
Investigate correlations between life expectancy and provided features by the dataset (e.g. GDP, immunization rates)
Build statistical models to predict Life expectancy.
Compare patterns between developed and developing countries using different techniques.

📌 Notes
Dataset source: WHO Life Expectancy Data

The analysis is for educational purposes and aims to practice data science techniques on a real-world dataset.
